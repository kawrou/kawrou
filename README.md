## Hobbies & Other Interests
- **Sports:** Always been a lover of basketball. Picked up badminton through coaching sessions whilst teaching in Korea.
- **Games:** Been a fan of RPGs like Final Fantasy since FF9 and played Warhammer when I was young. Big fan of Hideo Kojima (Metal Gear Solid series and Death Stranding). Got into board games during covid. Now amassed a large collection of them. Most replayed is probably _"Catan"_. Most recent additions are _"Ready, Set, Bet"_, _"Las Vegas"_, and _"Coffee Rush"_. 
- **Languages:** Despite growing up in a bilingual environment (Cantonese, English) and probably because of it, I was never good at European langauges growing up. However, one of the best experiences I received whilst living in Korea was studying becoming conversational in Korean.
